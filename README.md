## NumerAIc - Deep Learning using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Welcome to NumerAIc, a number guessing AI app! I'm experimenting how neural networks behave and learn on its own. The main goal of this app is for AI to guess your drawn number (correctly, I hope!). The AI's success/accuracy rate should be 95% or higher!

I have used MNIST dataset to train my neural network and then created my own dataset (hand drawn in paint) for out-of-sample testing. Tweaking the learning rate and layer sizes (increasing stride, padding, etc.) allowed me to train the network to generalize more, increase training speed, and increase accuracy for any out-of-sample data.

It's a very simple app but I had fun exploring the fundamentals of deep learning. I hope you enjoy playing with it as much as I have making it!
